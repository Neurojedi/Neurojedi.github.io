This repository contains Python implementations of commonly used bioinformatics algorithms, including Local Alignment, Global Alignment, Alignment with Affine Gap Penalties, Contig Generation, Greedy Motif Search, Random Motif Search, and more. Additionally, it includes solutions for Rosalind problems such as Leaderboard Cyclopeptide Sequencing, Convolution Cyclopeptide Sequencing, and Maximal Non-Branching Paths. These functions were developed for my assignments in the first three courses of the [Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics) on Coursera. Each subfolder in this repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that provides an introduction to the functions within that folder.
