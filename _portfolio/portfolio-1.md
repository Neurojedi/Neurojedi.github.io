In this repository, you will find Jupyter notebooks that introduce machine learning algorithms by combining mathematical aspects behind the algorithms and practices. Currently, there are 20 notebooks in the following subjects:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. GLM and Robust Regression
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Naive Bayes Classifier
6. Dimensionality Reduction

I am planning to expand this repository with around 40 notebooks. Each folder within the repository contains descriptions of the notebooks it houses. For instance, the 'Linear Regression' folder provides short explanations of the content covered in those specific notebooks.
