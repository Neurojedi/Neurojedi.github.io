In this repository, you will find my notes on Fundamentals of Deep Learning in which I gathered the building blocks of most deep learning algorithms. I used mainly three resources for creating these notebooks, I took my notes from [GÃ©ron, A. (2022)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/) and [Chollet, F. (2021)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition) and combined them with [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=deeplearningai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=WebsiteCoursesDLSTopButton) on Coursera. In each notebook, I also provide a bunch of new resources that I found helpful. These notebooks are more focus-on hands-on practice with also a little bit of theory provided. I think these notebooks would be most useful for those who have prior experience with the course on Coursera as well as those who have experience with the aforementioned books or some experience in deep learning.
