This repository contains an extended work on my covid data analysis in my last Linear Regression notebook, as well as an assignment for the Programming with Python (SE307) course that I took last semester. In this notebook, I have extended the dates of analysis from the previous notebook and added some time series visualizations. Additionally, I have included the MATLAB script used to create the CSV files. Please feel free to explore the notebook and files and provide any feedback or suggestions.
