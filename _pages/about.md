Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I recently earned my bachelor's degree in Molecular Biology and Genetics from Uskudar University. Simultaneously, I'm in my final year of studying Software Engineering as my second major. My primary research focus lies in Neuroscience, where I leverage machine learning to analyze signals and images. Moreover, I previously worked on the development of gene therapy approaches for treating neurological genetic disorders. I thrive on challenges, constantly seeking opportunities to learn and share knowledge, as I believe its true value lies not just in acquiring it, but in sharing it.

Research
======

I am dedicated to unraveling the mechanisms by which information processing in neural cells enable the brain to perceive and interpret the world around us. This multifaceted inquiry encompasses various levels of abstraction, ranging from the intricate interactions of signaling pathways to the computational dynamic behaviors of natural neural networks. To comprehend the complexity of the brain, I employ computational models and machine learning techniques. My primary objective is to gain a deep understanding of the dynamics present in high-dimensional data, unveiling the underlying patterns that shape neural activity. By leveraging these insights, I believe we can not only unravel the mysteries of the brain but also comprehend the hidden dynamics within neural networks. Furthermore, we can propel the development of novel computational models that exceed the capabilities of current AI frameworks.

I am currently interning at the [Centre for Medical Image Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/centre-medical-image-computing-cmic) at the University College London, where my primary focus is on developing predictive approaches for Alzheimer's Disease. Utilizing a range of biomarkers obtained from various data sources, including MRI, PET, DTI, and genetics tests, I am employing Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques in my research under the supervision of [Neil Oxtoby](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=NOXTO55) and [Maetrei Kohli](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/M.Kohli.html).

Additionally, I am an active member of the Neural Data Science and Statistical Computing Group at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en). I am proud and privileged to be working under the guidance of [Nico Scherf](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/nscherf/1448721) alongside an amazing team. Within this role, I am involved in addressing diverse challenges such as Manifold Learning, Cell Segmentation, and Brain Parcellation.

Prior to my current positions, I gained valuable experience at [Transgenic Cell Technologies and the Epigenetics Application and Research Center (TRGENMER)](https://uskudar.edu.tr/trgenmer/en) during my undergraduate studies in Molecular Biology and Genetics. Under the supervision of Cihan TASTAN, I contributed to several gene therapy projects targeting rare diseases, including Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Retinitis Pigmentosa. Techniques such as CRISPR Prime Editing and Antisense Oligonucleotide were employed in these projects. Notably, our project titled **"In Vitro and Ex Vitro Study of New Generation CRISPR-Prime Editing Targeting Exon 7/Intron 7 of SMN2 Gene Regulation in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Approaches in SMN1 Encoding Motor Neuron Cell-Specific Neural Lentivirus"** has received full funding from the [Health Institutes of Turkey (TUSEB)](https://www.tuseb.gov.tr/en/corporate/about-us). My particular focus in this endeavor was the development of lentiviral vectors with precise targeting capabilities for neurons, motor neurons, and photoreceptors. This project extended to my thesis work, which was titled ["Design of Neuron-Specific Lentiviral Vectors and Investigation of Gene Therapy Applications in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Disease."](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372389163_Design_of_Neuron-specific_Lentiviral_Vectors_and_Investigation_of_Gene_Therapy_Applications_in_Spinal_Muscular_Atrophy_Disease)

In addition to my research endeavors, I have a strong passion for sharing knowledge, which has led me to create Jupyter notebooks to disseminate the machine learning concepts I learn. You can find these notebooks on my GitHub profile, where I regularly update and share them. Furthermore, I firmly believe in maintaining a balance between mental and physical well-being. To achieve this, I actively engage in powerlifting to challenge myself physically. Additionally, I find joy in playing the drums and our traditional instrument, baÄŸlama, as a means of creative expression and relaxation.

If you have any inquiries, wish to collaborate on a project, or simply have questions, please feel free to reach out to me.
