- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a fourth-year Molecular Biology and Genetics student who is also double-majoring (3rd year) in Software Engineering.
- ðŸ§  My main research interest is Neuroscience where I use Machine Learning and Deep Learning for analysis of signals and images. In addition, I am working on using gene editing techniques for treatment of neurological genetic disorders. More specifically, I am interested in using ML/DL for analysis of Neural Manifolds/Spaces using connectome and image data as well as I am interested in developing novel lentiviral vectors for transfusing CRISPR systems to neurons in order to treat people with neurological rare diseases.
- ðŸ’» Here I will be sharing my Machine Learning and Deep Learning notes as well as my projects for medical data analysis (generally neural data). Furthermore, my plan is also to share genomic data analysis and bioinformatics stuff.
- âš¡ I love listening to AC/DC, Guns N' Roses, Halestorm, Nightwish, Kiss, Metallica, Black Sabbath, and Iron Maiden. Also I have a science history blog on

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
