I am dedicated to unraveling the mechanisms by which information processing in neural cells enables the brain to perceive and interpret the world around us. This multifaceted inquiry encompasses various levels of abstraction, ranging from the intricate interactions of signaling pathways to the computational dynamic behaviors of natural neural networks. My primary objective is to gain a deep understanding of the dynamics present in high-dimensional data, unveiling the underlying patterns that shape neural activity. By leveraging these insights, I believe we can not only unravel the mysteries of the brain but also comprehend the hidden dynamics within artificial neural networks. Furthermore, we can propel the development of novel computational models that exceed the capabilities of current AI frameworks.

I am an active member of the Neural Data Science and Statistical Computing Group at the **[Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en)**. I am proud and privileged to be working under the guidance of **[Nico Scherf](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/person/nscherf/1448721)** alongside an amazing team. Within this role, I am involved in addressing diverse challenges such as Manifold Learning, Cell Segmentation, and Brain Parcellation.

Prior to my current position, I gained valuable experience at **[Transgenic Cell Technologies and the Epigenetics Application and Research Center (TRGENMER)](https://uskudar.edu.tr/trgenmer/en)** during my undergraduate studies in Molecular Biology and Genetics. Under the supervision of **[Cihan TASTAN](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cihan-Tastan)**, I contributed to several gene therapy projects targeting rare diseases, including Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Retinitis Pigmentosa. I have also recently completed my summer internship at the **[Centre for Medical Image Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/centre-medical-image-computing-cmic)** at the University College London, where my primary focus was on developing predictive approaches for Alzheimer's Disease utilizing a range of biomarkers obtained from various data sources, including MRI, PET, DTI, and genetics tests under the supervision of **[Neil Oxtoby](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=NOXTO55)** and **[Maetrei Kohli](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/M.Kohli.html)**.

In addition to my research endeavors, I have a strong passion for sharing knowledge, which has led me to create Jupyter notebooks to disseminate the machine learning concepts I learn. You can find these notebooks on my **[GitHub profile](https://github.com/Neurojedi)**, where I regularly update and share them. Furthermore, I firmly believe in maintaining a balance between mental and physical well-being. To achieve this, I actively engage in powerlifting to challenge myself physically. Additionally, I find joy in playing the drums and our traditional instrument, baÄŸlama, as a means of creative expression and relaxation.

If you have any inquiries, wish to collaborate on a project, or simply have questions, please feel free to reach out to me.
